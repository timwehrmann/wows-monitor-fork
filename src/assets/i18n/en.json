    "description": "This is a tool that i built for myself and thought maybe others can use it too. <br/> It came from having multiple clients (EU, NA, ST, PublicTest, ...) for which i always had to go into the engine_config to set things like maxFrameRate after every update. <br/> While in the main client i could do that with AslainsMod, i usually set more than just the framerate. Additional to that, in the special clients mods don't work and it was easier to just write a tool that adjusts all clients at the same time. <br /> <br />I originally found information about these values in this post <a href=\"https://forum.worldofwarships.com/topic/42946-engine_configxml-fps-loading-stuttering-fix/\">https://forum.worldofwarships.com/topic/42946-engine_configxml-fps-loading-stuttering-fix/</a> and i just stuck with it ever since. <br /> <br /> If you have any parameters in the engine_config you think i should add just ping me on discord. :)",
